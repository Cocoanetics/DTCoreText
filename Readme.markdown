DTCoreText
==========

This project aims to duplicate the methods present on Mac OSX which allow creation of `NSAttributedString` from HTML code on iOS. 

The project covers two broad areas:

1. **Layouting** - Interfacing with CoreText, generating attributed strings from HTML code
2. **User Interface** - UI-related classes render these objects, specifically `DTAttributedTextView`, `DTAttributedLabel` and `DTAttributedTextCell`.

This is useful for drawing simple rich text like any HTML document without having to use a `UIWebView`. For text selection and highlighting (as you might need for an Editor or Reader) there is the commercial **DTRichTextEditor** component which can be purchased in the [Cocoanetics Parts Store](http://www.cocoanetics.com/parts/dtrichtexteditor/).
