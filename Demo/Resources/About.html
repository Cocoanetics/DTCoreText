	<p>DTCoreText consists of two portions:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Parsing HTML</b> and creating NSAttributedStrings</li>
		<li><b>UI Classes</b> for properly displaying these</li>
		</ol>
	<p>This page demonstrates a DTAttributedTextView being loaded from a XIB. You can see how this line wraps if you rotate the device.</p>

	<p>For example you could create a rich text about view like this here</p>
	<p style="color:red"><b>Note:</b>You need to disable auto-layout on view controllers loading views from XIB because at present DTCoreText is not yet able to dynamically re-layout in auto-layout views.</p>
