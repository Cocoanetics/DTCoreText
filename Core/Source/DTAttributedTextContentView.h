 Attributed Text Content Views display attributed strings generated by DTHTMLAttributedStringBuilder. They can display images and hyperlinks inline or optionally place custom subviews (which get provided via the <delegate> in the appropriate places. By itself content views do not scroll, for that there is the `UIScrollView` subclass <DTAttributedTextView>.
 
 Generally you have two options to providing content:
 
 - set the attributed string
 - set a layout frame
 
 The first you would normally use, the second you would use if you are layouting a larger text and then simply want to display individual parts (e.g. pages from an e-book) in a content view.
 
 DTAttributedTextContentView is designed to be used as the content view inside a DTAttributedTextView and thus sizes its intrinsicContentSize always to be the same as the width of the set frame. Use DTAttributedLabel if you don't require scrolling behavior.
