 This class represents a single frame of text and basically wraps CTFrame. It provides an array of text lines that fit in the given rectangle.
 
 Both styles of layouting are supported: open ended (suitable for scroll views) and limited to a given rectangle. To use the open-ended style specify `CGFLOAT_OPEN_HEIGHT` for the <frame> height when creating a layout frame.
 
 The array of lines is built lazily the first time it is accessed or - for open-ended frames - when the frame property is being queried.
